# MindBindJS

A Pomodoro app that records usage, enabling data-driven insights about the user's productivity.

The general flow of a Pomodoro is very simple:

1. Do useful stuff, typically for 25 minutes
2. Take a short break, typically for 5 minutes
3. Repeat from step 1

With MindBindJS, the process is only slightly more complicated:

1. Do useful stuff, typically for 25 minutes
2. Pick a score from 0-10 (inclusive) and optionally a short summary of how productive the time was
3. Take a short break, typically for 5 minutes
4. Repeat from step 1

From this, and capturing the user's interactions with the app in the form of events, MindBind can build a picture over time of how productive the user is, and potentially insights into what makes the user productive.
